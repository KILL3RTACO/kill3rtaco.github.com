			<h2 id='About'>About</h2>
			<p>
				The idea for ItemMail came to me whilst playing on my regular server, <a href='http://ww.imdeity.com'>imdeity.com</a>.
				This server has many towns and shop, and at the time player trading was common. The problem was that usually these players
				would to a town spawn, but could not decide which, or go to the server spawn and risk other players stealing they're items.
				My idea was that through a simple command, player's would be able to 'send' items to another player, without the need to move.
			</p>
			<h2 id='History'>History</h2>
			<p>
				In the first version of the plugin, I used a Java Object called a HashMap to store everyone's mail. I was a noob at programming
				during this time, and I later realized that if the server was shut down or restarted/reloaded, everyone's mail would be gone. I
				fixed this somewhat in the next version
			</p>
			<p>
				In this version, I used MySQL databases to store the mail. It was something I really wanted to implement after learning the
				disadvantages of HashMaps. MySql databases have two main advantages:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>They are easy to manipulate</li>
				<li>They are stored on a server, so even if the server went off the Mail is safe</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				However shortly after this advancement, Echantments were possible. The MySQL tables do not store Enchantment data. I am working
				a way to hold that data. At the moment, however, any item sent with Echantments will lose their Echantment.

			<h2 id='Sending_Mail'>Sending Mail</h2>
			<p>
				The main feature of the plugin is sending mail. The syntax for the command is as follows:
			</p>
			<code>
				/im send [player] [item:damage] [amount]
			</code>
			<h3 id='Sending_Mail_Parameters'>Parameters</h3>
			<p>
				This command has three different parameters.
			</p>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>Parameter</th>
					<th>Required</th>
					<th>Description</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>[player]</td>
					<td>yes</td>
					<td>Defines who you're sending the items to.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>[item:damage]</td>
					<td>yes</td>
					<td>
						Defines what you are sending. It can be the name of item, such as "bed", or the id of an item. You can specify
						damage/data values as well, so you can send a specific type of wool/dye/log etc.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>[amount]</td>
					<td>no</td>
					<td>
						Defines the amount of the item you are sending (default: 1). An error will be sent if you do not have enough (for
						instance if you want to send 12 diamonds but you only have 4).
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<h2 id='Sending_Requests'>Sending Requests</h2>
			<p>
				Requests are another feature in ItemMail where you can ask other players for mail. If the request is accepted, the requested items
				will be sent to you as if they entered the command:
			</p>
			<code>
				/im send [yourname] [requested-items]
			</code>
			<p>
				However, if it is declined, the items will not be sent.
			</p>
			<p>
				The syntax for the command to send a request is as follows:
			</p>
			<code>
				/im req [name] [item:damage] [amount]
			</code>
			<h3 id='Sending_Requests_Parameters'>Parameters</h3>
			<p>
				This command has three different parameters.
			</p>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>Parameter</th>
					<th>Required</th>
					<th>Description</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>[player]</td>
					<td>yes</td>
					<td>Defines who you are requesting the items from.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>[item:damage]</td>
					<td>yes</td>
					<td>
						Defines what you are requesting. It can be the name of item, such as "bed", or the id of an item. You can specify
						damage/data values as well.

				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>[amount]</td>
					<td>no</td>
					<td>
						Defines the amount of the item you are requesting (default: 1).

			<h2 id='Player_Mailboxes'>Player Mailboxes</h2>
			<p>
				Each player has two different Mailboxes: one that stores mail and another that stores requests. Each of these Mailboxes has
				its own command to access. These mailboxes use a page system, so you always see a set number of mail on each page (unless
				perhaps you are viewing the last page).
			</p>
			<h2 id='Accessing_Mail'>Accessing Mail</h2>
			<p>
				To see mail that was sent to you, type the command
			</p>
			<code>
				/im [page]
			</code>
			<p>
				The <span class='inline-code'>[page]</span> parameter defines which page you are viewing.
			</p>
			<h3 id='Opening_Mail'>Opening Mail</h3>
			<p>
				Mail sent to you doesn't have a use until you open it (duh). To open mail, type the command
			</p>
			<code>
				/im open [#]
			</code>
			<p>
				The <span class='inline-code'>[#]</span> parameter defines which mail to open. When viewing your mail, a number (starting
				at 1) appears on the left of each item. For example, the first item will have an id of <span class='inline-code'>[1]</span>,
				the second item will have an id of <span class='inline-code'>[2]</span>, and so on. Here is an example of what the mailbox looks
				like when viewed:
			</p>
			<code>
				--------------[ItemMail: Page 1 of 1]--------------<br/>
				[1] FROM: Notch ITEMS: 25 CAKE<br/>
				[2] FROM: Notch ITEMS: 85 DIAMOND<br/>
				[3] FROM: Notch ITEMS: 10 IRON_INGOT<br/>
				[4] FROM: Notch ITEMS: 1032 TNT<br/>
				---------------------------------------------------
			</code>
			<p>
				If in this case you wanted the diamonds, you would type
			</p>
			<code>
				/im open 2
			</code>
			<p>
				If you do not specify a number, the plugin will try to open the last mail sent to you. In this case, that would be the 
				<span class='inline-code'>1032 TNT</span>. However if you give a number and that mail doesn't exist (or don't specify
				a number and you have no mail in your mailbox), you will get an error message saying "That mail doesn't exist!";
			</p>
			<h3 id='Deleting_Mail'>Deleting Mail</h3>
			<p>
				But what if you don't want the mail? You can easily delete it with
			</p>
			<code>
				/im delete [#/*]
			</code>
			<p>
				If the last parameter is a number (and that mail exists) it will delete that mail. It does not actually 'delete' it from
				the MySQL database (so admins can still see), but it marks it as read without giving you the items.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can also delete all of your mail by using an asterisk (*) instead of a number.
			</p>
			<h2 id='Accessing_Requests'>Accessing Requests</h2>
			<p>
				Viewing your requests is much like viewing your mail. However the is an extra parameter:
			</p>
			<code>
				/im reqs [page]
			</code>
			<p>
				The parameter <span class='inline-code'>reqs</span> is required to view requests. Otherwise, you would be viewing your mail.
			</p>
			<h3 id='Accepting_Requests'>Accepting Requests</h3>
			<p>
				To accept a request, use the command
			</p>
			<code>
				/im accept [#]
			</code>
			<p>
				If you don't give a number, the plugin will try accept the last request sent to you. Accepting a request is the same thing as:
			</p>
			<code>
				/im send [sender-of-request] [requested-items]
			</code>
			<h3 id='Declining_Requests'>Declining Requests</h3>
			<p>
				If you do not wish to accept a request, you can always decline it. To do this type the command
			</p>
			<code>
				/im decline [#]
			</code>
			<p>
				If you don't give a number, the plugin will decline the last request sent to you (if any).
