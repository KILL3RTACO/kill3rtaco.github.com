					Every player can fall into one of these categories. From regular players who enjoy the game for what it is, to the coders who try to make the game even better,
					the Minecraft community is extremely diverse.

				<h2 id='Minecraft_Community'>Minecraft Community</h2>
				<p>
					The Minecraft community is full of many different kinds of people. From the regular players who play just to play, to the coders, texturepack makers, and
					adventure map creators, you get a melting pot of people that help make Minecraft what it is today.
				<p>
				<h2 id='#Regular_Players'>Regular Players</h2>
				<p>
					There are players in Minecraft who play the game for the enjoyment of playing, the don't really have a role in the community. YouTubers often use other
					creations from the community in the videos, which includes mods, maps, and texture-packs as well.
				</p>
				<h2 id='#YouTubers'>YouTubers</h2>
				<p>
					YouTubers in general have a good sense of taste and humor. They can entertain the public with general ease.
				</p>
				<h2 id='#Normal_Players'>Normal Players</h2>
				<p>
					Normal players can either be annoying noobs or veteran players. In multiplayer servers they can also be popular, often these players are referred to
					by other players or even the staff, and are known as 'regulars'. The noobs on the other hand aren't really communicated with by 'popular' players that
					much, and are usually seen hanging around other noobs.
				</p>
				<h2 id='#Artists'>Artists</h2>
				<p>
					Artists can sometimes be seen as the core of the community. They help make the game what it is. Mods often become a built in feature, and with the common
					creation of adventure maps, Adventure Mode has been built into the game. Artists include mod-makers (whether they be for a server or client-side), texture-pack
					creators, and adventure map builders.
				</p>
				<h2 id='#Coders'>Coders</h2>
				<p>
					Coders tend to see the world a different way. These people can generally solve critical thinking problems easier depending on their experience.
					These people can develop client-mods or even server-mods, and have a better knowledge of the game than most. They can answer questions on why something
					doesn't work just by looking at code in most cases.
				</p>
				<h2 id='#Graphics'>Graphics</h2>
				<p>
					This part of the community includes players who make texture packs. It also includes players online who make banners/signatures for other players.
					The graphics part of the community can choose how they see the minecraft world more easily than others. Depending on the resolution, the graphics
					community can have a natural ability for pixel art.
				</p>
				<h2 id='Builders'>Builders</h2>
				<p>
					Builders don't just choose how they want to see the world, they <i>make</i> it. They may spend their time often in creative mode building away
					at a structure. Some parts of the community are better at making a structure or a building whereas others may have more interest in making adventure
					maps.
